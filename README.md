Welcome to the backend repository of my football (soccer) league score-tracking mobile app developed as my onboarding project at Retailo Technologies. This full-stack application is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for managing and tracking scores in a hypothetical football (soccer) league.

## Core Technologies Used

- **NestJS**

- **PostgreSQL**

- **ReactNative**

- **Redux**

## Key Features

### 1. View Fixtures

- Users can view both upcoming and past fixtures within the football league.
